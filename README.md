Welcome to FlexYoga, a user-friendly web application designed to streamline the registration process for yoga classes. This project was developed as part of an internship assignment at Flexmoney, and it leverages the MERN stack to provide a seamless experience for both users and administrators.

Project Overview
Frontend Development
The frontend of FlexYoga is crafted with HTML, CSS, and ReactJS to ensure a visually appealing and intuitive admission form. Special attention has been given to responsiveness, guaranteeing a consistent and distortion-free display across various devices.

Backend Development
Powered by NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB, the backend of the form handles data processing and storage. The connection between the frontend and backend is established to facilitate smooth communication and a robust user experience.

Basic Validations
To enhance user data integrity, the following basic validations have been implemented:

Mandatory Fields: Every input field must be filled out by the user.
User Name: The user's name must not be empty.
Age: The age field must contain a value between 18 and 65 years.
Gender: Users are required to specify their gender.
Contact Number: The contact number must consist of 10 digits.
Fees: The fee amount should exactly match 500.
Slot Selection: Users must choose a slot to proceed with payment.
Successful Registration
Upon successful registration, users are greeted with a "Payment Successful" message, providing a positive confirmation of their enrollment.

Future Enhancements
This project has the potential for real-world application by incorporating a payment method. Future developments could include integrating payment gateways for UPI or card transactions, making the registration process not only seamless but also financially secure.
